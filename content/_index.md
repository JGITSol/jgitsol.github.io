# Welcome to my personal website

My name is JÄ™drzej Grabala, and I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a background in Control Engineering & Robotics. This website is dedicated mostly to my current projects, upcoming releases, and useful knowledge for anyone interested, at least vaguely, in the AI realm.

## Websites I Highly Recommend

If you want to stay on top of current AI news, these are some websites I highly recommend:

- [Emergent Mind](https://www.emergentmind.com) - Papers explained with AI, useful for understanding complex topics
- [OXEN.AI](https://www.oxen.ai) - Great place to find&host datasets, weekly dives into AI papers on-line with engineers from around the world!
- [Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co) - My favourite AI models/spaces/datasets library, great for fast prototyping.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) - Similar as above, just not as intuitive for me, but hey- many people use it for a reason !
- [Dev.IO](https://www.dev.to) - Articles news source, daily inspiration, helpful community of programmers
